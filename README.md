my attempt at GitHub Pages

<br/><br/>
more to come... need to research on how to configure the GitHub Pages

<br/><br/>
so far i have two repo's .. one for gathering the documentation i want to have as a static website; 
second repo is this one which is expected to execute the website; 
i have still not understood how to connect my journal-repo to feed as source for github.io-repo

<br> another popssibility is that the markdown documentation needs to be part of this githubio repo itself and needs to be kept on separate branch.
